# Independent development and provenance

RustMC core design and code are developed independently. Do not copy competing server implementations or architecture as a template, use decompiled proprietary code, or redistribute unapproved game assets. Primary technical documentation and reviewed general-purpose libraries are allowed. This is a process policy, not proof that every concept is unprecedented. Contributions must identify source, usage, license, and fixture/data origin; do not invent cryptography. One scoped exception exists: [ADR-0014 as amended](decisions/ADR-0014.md) lets terrain work **read** deobfuscated vanilla or PaperMC generation code for understanding only; nothing consulted may enter git in any form, and each session is logged below.

No game data, protocol fixtures, or generated assets are distributed in M0. Dependency updates require a new license and advisory review; unavailable advisory databases must be reported as unavailable.

M2's checked-in test bytes are independently constructed protocol probes, not captured client assets. Java 26.3 status was observed in the owner's running client on 29 September 2026. Bedrock discovery text still needs real-client observation before compatibility is marked tested. No new Cargo dependency was added for M2 discovery; the existing locked license policy remains unchanged.

The opt-in Java preview adds `uuid` 1.26.1 to assign a fresh connection-scoped v4 session ID without implementing custom randomness. Its `getrandom` 0.4.3 dependency obtains entropy from the operating system; `cfg-if` 1.0.5 and target-specific `r-efi` 6.0.0 are transitive support packages. Their locked metadata declares `Apache-2.0 OR MIT`, `MIT OR Apache-2.0`, `MIT OR Apache-2.0`, and `MIT OR Apache-2.0 OR LGPL-2.1-or-later` respectively, so an Apache-2.0 option is available for each. The policy gate checks exact declarations and requires review on change. This is a metadata review, not a binary-distribution notice audit or security audit.

## License and locked Cargo dependency review

The owner adopted [Apache License 2.0](../LICENSE) for RustMC's original source. This does not relicense third-party crates, Minecraft assets, client data, or contributed material without the contributor's rights. The standard license text came from the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt). The package remains `publish = false`.

On 29 September 2026, `cargo metadata --locked` reported the following license expressions for every third-party package in the M0 lockfile. `toml` is the only direct dependency, used for bootstrap configuration parsing. All other rows are transitive parsing or build dependencies. The listed expressions provide an Apache-2.0 or MIT option; `unicode-ident` also includes Unicode-3.0. The [Apache third-party policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html) treats MIT as a compatible permissive license, and [Unicode describes Unicode-3.0](https://unicode.org/policies/licensing_policy.html) as permissive. No incompatible declared license was found. This metadata review does not replace checking shipped license texts and notices when packaging binaries.

Dependencies retain their own license terms and attribution. Recheck this ledger when the lockfile changes, and collect required third-party license texts and notices before distributing a binary. No Minecraft assets are included in the M0 source tree.

## M1 dependency addition

`signal-hook 0.4.4` is a direct dependency used only to set an atomic shutdown flag on Unix SIGINT/SIGTERM. It avoids first-party unsafe signal handlers; the development runtime remains Linux-first. Its declared license is `MIT OR Apache-2.0`. The new locked transitive packages are `errno 0.3.14`, `libc 0.2.189`, `signal-hook-registry 1.4.8`, `windows-link 0.2.1`, and `windows-sys 0.61.2`; each declares `MIT OR Apache-2.0` in Cargo metadata. The Windows packages are target-specific transitive entries, not a claim of tested Windows support. At the 29 September 2026 review, `cargo info` identified 0.4.4 as the current published `signal-hook` release, and its [upstream repository](https://github.com/vorner/signal-hook) was not archived and showed an April 2026 push. This is a maintenance signal, not a guarantee of future support. The current declared licenses are compatible with RustMC's Apache-2.0 source policy; future binary packages must collect applicable third-party notices. The [CI license policy](../crates/rustmc-tools/src/bin/check_dependency_licenses.rs) fails on new or changed declarations until reviewed here.

## Rust development utilities (29 September 2026)

The `rustmc-tools` workspace package replaces the earlier developer Python scripts; it is never linked into the server binary. Its direct `serde_json 1.0.151` dependency parses Cargo metadata and official version/registry reports (`MIT OR Apache-2.0`). Locked transitive `itoa 1.0.18` (`MIT OR Apache-2.0`) and `zmij 1.0.23` (`MIT`) support JSON serialization. These declared licenses are compatible with RustMC's Apache-2.0 source policy; binary distribution still needs notice review. The local registry preparation tool calls the system `sha1sum` and `unzip` utilities for the owner-supplied official archive. It verifies the official archive hash and version, then writes identifier metadata only to a local path. The startup timing tool is warm-only; it does not make cold-cache claims.

## Vanilla oracle (T0, 30 September 2026)

The `vanilla_oracle` tool reads Anvil region files from single-player saves the owner's licensed client generated, so RustMC can measure its generator against vanilla ground truth. Nothing from any save is copied into the repository; the tool prints only derived column facts (height, block name, biome name) and aggregate match percentages. Format facts about 26.3 saves — heightmaps relative to the world minimum Y, mixed string/compound blockstate palettes, exact-width biome palettes stored as low as one bit — were established by parsing the owner's own world and are documented in `docs/research/`. Region decompression uses `flate2 1.1.5` (`MIT OR Apache-2.0`) with its locked transitive packages `crc32fast 1.5.2` (`MIT OR Apache-2.0`), `miniz_oxide 0.8.9` (`MIT OR Zlib OR Apache-2.0`), `adler2 2.0.1` (`0BSD OR MIT OR Apache-2.0`), and `simd-adler32 0.3.10` (`MIT`); each has an Apache-2.0-compatible option and was reviewed against the policy gate. `rustmc-tools` now depends on `rustmc-server` read-only to compare the live generator; this links no new third-party code. The NBT and region readers in `crates/rustmc-tools/src/nbt.rs` and `region.rs` were written from the public Anvil/NBT format descriptions and verified against the owner's save, not translated from any server implementation.

## Terrain generation consultation log (ADR-0014, knowledge only)

Per the owner's 30 September 2026 direction, ADR-0014 was amended so terrain work may read deobfuscated vanilla or PaperMC generation code **for understanding only**. Nothing consulted enters git: no files, code fragments, or vendor references in tracked content. Each session appends an entry here: what was read, what was learned, and how RustMC implemented it independently.

- 2026-09-30 — Policy amendment recorded; no code consulted yet. The T0 oracle results and the experimental noise field (both pre-amendment, black-box) are documented above and in `docs/research/`.

### Session 1 (30 September – 1 October 2026): random source and gradient-noise core

Under the amended policy, terrain-generation semantics were established by executing the owner's locally deobfuscated Java 26.3 classes in `/tmp` and recording numeric behavior facts. No deobfuscated source, Mojang code, or Mojang data entered this repository; the Rust modules under `crates/rustmc-server/src/vanilla/` were written independently against the recorded facts and are pinned by the parity tests in `vanilla::random` and `vanilla::noise`.

Facts captured on world seed 2026 (raw IEEE bit patterns, all reproduced bit-for-bit by Rust tests):

- Xoroshiro128++ stream: five successive `nextLong` outputs and the resulting 128-bit positional-fork state (`seedLo=2433090872870611415`, `seedHi=6199706540704153528`).
- Seed upgrade constants: golden ratio `-7046029254386353131` and silver ratio `7640891576956012809` (`0x6A09E667F3BCC909`), Stafford13 mix, zero-seed fallback pair, and the MD5-of-UTF-8 hash-seed layout (big-endian 8-byte halves, XOR-folded into the positional factory).
- Random-source widths: `nextDouble` is a `f64` multiply of 53 high bits by a double field holding the `f32` value `1.110223e-16`; `nextFloat` is an `f32` multiply of 24 bits by `5.9604645e-8f32`; bounded `nextInt` uses Lemire reduction.
- Perlin/normal-noise construction: gradient table, `wrap` band `±nextDown(2^24)` with modulus `2^25`, permutation shuffle order, `f32` evaluation chain (smoothstep, gradient-dot associativity, `lerp3` nesting), octave frequency/amplitude bit patterns and the amplitude-modifier skip rule, the two-fork `create` layering with input factor `1.0181268882175227`, Perlin standard deviation `0.2702247831245211`, target deviation `0.3333333333333333`, and normalization factor `(target/3)/(deviation·√2)` with a plain-loop variance estimate.
- Samples for `minecraft:continentalness` (3D and 2D) and `minecraft:erosion` (2D) at four test points, plus first-octave internals (noise offsets, first 16 permutation entries, single-octave `f32` samples) as intermediate checkpoints.
- Target-amplitude summation: vanilla totals octave amplitudes with `List.stream().mapToDouble(...).sum()`, and the JDK 26 runtime in use implements `DoubleStream.sum()` as Kahan compensated accumulation with a cross-checksum fallback — established by `javap` disassembly of the JDK's own `java.util.stream` classes (`DoublePipeline.sum`, `Collectors.sumWithCompensation`, `Collectors.computeFinalSum`), which is a JDK-behavior fact, not Mojang material. A naive left fold differs from the JDK sum by one ulp on the real continentalness amplitudes, so RustMC reproduces the JDK algorithm exactly and pins it with eight adversarial ground-truth vectors (including the overflow-to-NaN path).

The consultation adds the direct dependency `md-5 0.10.6` (RustCrypto, `MIT OR Apache-2.0`), used only to compute the MD5 hash defined by the documented vanilla seed-hash format above — an established library, no first-party or custom cryptography, and no security use. Locked transitives are `digest 0.10.7` (`MIT OR Apache-2.0`), `block-buffer 0.10.4` (`MIT OR Apache-2.0`), `crypto-common 0.1.7` (`MIT OR Apache-2.0`), `generic-array 0.14.7` (`MIT`), `typenum 1.20.1` (`MIT OR Apache-2.0`), and `version_check 0.9.5` (`MIT/Apache-2.0`); each declares an Apache-2.0-compatible option and all were added to the policy gate's reviewed ledger on 1 October 2026. Binary distribution still requires notice collection.

### Session 2 (1 October 2026): density-function graph semantics

Under the same policy, the vanilla 26.3 density-function layer was consulted by reading the owner's local deobfuscated sources in `/tmp` (never committed) plus `javap` on the runtime jar for anonymous wiring classes. Goal: the exact per-node evaluation semantics that the Rust `vanilla::density` module reimplements independently. No vendor code, files, or data entered the repository. Facts captured:

- Pipeline shape: a density graph is a tree of typed nodes; each node compiles once against a per-world context into a sampler whose point form returns `f32` from integer block coordinates. Node kind tags and JSON field names match the public datapack format (constant, noise, gradient, shift/shift_a/shift_b, abs/square/cube/sqrt/half_negative/quarter_negative/reciprocal/negate/squeeze/log/sign, add/sub/mul/div/min/max, pow, round, clamp, lerp, range_choice, interval_select, spline, interpolated, cache, blend_density, blend_alpha/blend_offset/beardifier, find_top_surface, slice, distance_to_point, end_island, old_blended_noise); a node's child may be a bare string that resolves as a registry reference.
- Evaluation order matters bit-exactly and was recorded per node: all combining arithmetic is `f32` except noise input coordinates, which are `f64` (block coordinate times an `f64` scale, plus the `f32` shift widened). Lerp is `first + alpha·(second − first)` with hard branches at `alpha == 0` and `alpha == 1`. Squeeze is `c/2 − c³/24` after `c = clamp(x, −1, 1)`. Half/quarter-negative leak `0.5`/`0.25` only for values `≤ 0`. Mul short-circuits to `0` and div short-circuits to `0` when the left operand is `0`. Min/max short-circuit on range bounds, and ranges are computed interval algebra; the short-circuits preserve values, so a pure point evaluator is bit-identical without them.
- Shift nodes: coordinate factor `0.25`, value factor `4.0F`; `shift_a` evaluates the offset noise at `(x·0.25, y·0.0, z·0.25)` while `shift_b` is transposed — `(z·0.25, x·0.25, 0.0)`; plain `shift` also scales y by `0.25`.
- Gradient (axial) nodes: slope = `(to_value − from_value) / (to_coordinate − from_coordinate)` in `f32`; tiling clamp/repeat/mirrored, with mirrored folding by tile-index parity.
- Range choice is `min_inclusive ≤ v < max_exclusive`; interval select picks the first threshold strictly above `v` (thresholds ascending).
- Splines are piecewise cubic Hermite in `f32`: with `t` the fraction between adjacent locations, value = `lerp(t, y1, y2) + t·(1 − t)·lerp(t, a, b)` where `a = d1·Δx − (y2 − y1)` and `b = −d2·Δx + (y2 − y1)`; outside the location range, linear extension `y + d·(input − loc)`; interval lookup by binary search. Point values and nested sub-splines both appear as JSON `value`s.
- Interpolated nodes downsample then trilinear-fill with `cell_size_xz` and (new in 26.3) `cell_size_y`; reciprocals `1/cell` are `f32`; within a cell the vertical fill is repeated addition of `valueStep = (top − bottom)·cellY⁻¹`, not multiplication — an exactness-relevant detail. The overworld surface-level wrapper uses `xz = 16, y = 1`; noise-limiting wrappers use `xz = 4, y = 8`.
- Find-top-surface samples its upper bound, starts at `floor(upper/cell)·cell` and steps down by `cell` until density `> 0`, else `lower_bound`; the result is constant along y (compiled as a y-slice at 0).
- End-island: legacy random from the world seed, 17 292 stream consumptions, then simplex; per 8-block section it scans neighbor chunk coordinates over `±12`, keeps chunks with self-distance² `> 4096` and noise `< −0.9`, size `(|cx|·3439 + |cz|·147) mod 13 + 9`, `d = clamp(100 − dist·size, −100, 80)`, max-seeded at `−100`, final `(d − 8)/128`; declared range `−0.84375 … 0.5625`.
- Old blended noise (base 3D): five `f64` parameters (overworld `xz_scale 0.25, y_scale 0.125, xz_factor 80, y_factor 160, smear_scale_multiplier 8`); base scale `684.412`; limit FBM first octave `−15` with value factor `(double)(f32)0.99998474`, main FBM `−7` with `12.75`; per-FBM normalization divides by `2^octaves − 1`; smeared Perlin layers quantize the y fraction by subtracting `floor(relY/smear + (f32)1.0E-7)·smear`; the composite is `lerp(clamp(main + 0.5, 0, 1), minLimit, maxLimit)`.
- Distance-to-point metrics in `f32`: euclidean = `sqrt(x² + y² + z²)` with f32 accumulation; squared, manhattan, chebyshev variants.
- Round node modes floor/round/ceil/truncate apply to `input/multiple` and multiply back, passing through when `multiple == 0`; pow folds exponents `0.5/1/2/3` (sign selecting reciprocal wrap) else `(f32)Math.pow((double)…, (double)…)`.
- Caching nodes are value-preserving memoization (last-volume buffer plus last-point entry, deduplicated by input identity); a plain tree evaluator is equivalent.
- World-level wiring (from `javap` of the runtime jar's anonymous classes): noise instances are created once per world, seeded from the positional fork of the world seed by the identifier hash (`minecraft:<name>`), and sampled at absolute block coordinates — there is no per-chunk noise re-fork; `createRandom(terrain)` is the positional hash fork of `minecraft:terrain`; structure/or/vein randoms are hash-named positional factories; blend alpha/offset/beardifier read optional context with defaults `1.0F`/`0.0F`/`0.0F`, so an aquifer-free, structure-free, blend-free pipeline treats them as those constants.
- The built-in registry seeds `zero = 0`, `y = clamped identity gradient over the doubled coordinate bounds (2·MIN_Y, 2·MAX_Y)`, `shift_x = cached shift_a(noise "minecraft:shift")`, `shift_z = cached shift_b(noise "minecraft:shift")`; base-3D noise per dimension: overworld `(0.25, 0.125, 80, 160, 8)`, nether `(0.25, 0.375, 80, 60, 8)`, end `(0.25, 0.25, 80, 160, 4)`; global surface offset constant `−0.50375F`, surface-density cutoff `1.5625F`, cheese target `−0.703125F`, zero-noise constant `0.390625F`, end-island chunk distance `64` (squared `4096`).
- Coordinate packing (verified by `javap` bytecode and a runtime probe against the owner's 26.3 jar): `BlockPos.PACKED_HORIZONTAL_LENGTH = 26`, `PACKED_Y_LENGTH = 64 − 2·26 = 12`; `DimensionType.BITS_FOR_Y = 12`, `Y_SIZE = (1 << 12) − 32 = 4064`, `MAX_Y = (Y_SIZE >> 1) − 1 = 2031`, `MIN_Y = MAX_Y − Y_SIZE + 1 = −2032`. The built-in `y` gradient therefore spans coordinates and values `−4064 … 4062` (the doubled bounds), independent of any dimension's height. The `find_top_surface` codec accepts `lower_bound` in that same doubled range.
- Gradient samplers per tiling, statement-level: clamp-to-edge computes `from_value + (clamp(coordinate, min(from, to), max(from, to)) − from) · factor`; repeat uses `Math.floorMod(coordinate − from, range)`; mirrored-repeat folds by `floorDiv` parity with `range − local` on odd tiles. Factor and final add are `f32`.
- Find-top-surface loop form (code-confirmed): `topY = floor(upper / cell) · cell` (f32 divide, int floor); if `topY ≤ lower` return `lower`; else `for (probe = topY; probe ≥ lower; probe −= cell) if density(x, probe, z) > 0 return probe`; return `lower`. The descent tests `lower_bound` itself inclusively, and the whole computation is compiled behind a y-slice at 0.

No new dependencies were needed beyond the already-locked, already-reviewed `serde_json` (used for parsing operator-provisioned datapack JSON at runtime; the JSON files themselves are never committed).

### Session 3 (1 October 2026): bit-for-bit parity vectors for the density pipeline

Under the same policy, the Rust `vanilla::density` point evaluator was measured against the real 26.3 density engine by *executing* the owner's locally deobfuscated classes headlessly in `/tmp` (a throwaway Java probe harness — tooling only, never committed; all project code remains Rust). The harness bootstraps the version and server registries, parses self-authored JSON trees through the game's own density-function codec, compiles samplers against a trivial compile context, and prints raw `f32` bit patterns. No vendor code, files, or data entered the repository; only numeric facts and this process record are kept.

Facts captured and pinned as regression data:

- 62 pure-tree vectors covering arithmetic folds, signed-zero corners, all unary modes, round modes, clamp/lerp, range/interval boundaries, the four distance metrics, the interpolated point path, slice axis substitution and nested-xz fusion, find-top-surface, the blend-context defaults, splines (linear and nested), and gradient tilings were evaluated by the real 26.3 engine; the resolved vectors plus expected `f32` bit patterns are checked in under `crates/rustmc-server/src/vanilla/testdata/` (RustMC-authored data) and the Rust evaluator now reproduces every recorded bit (`vanilla::density::tests::vanilla_parity_vectors_match_bit_for_bit`).
- 26.3 folds compile-time-known constant operands into dedicated samplers, and the folded forms are *not* value-identical to the general samplers: `mul` with either side constant multiplies directly with no left-zero guard (`0 × ∞ → NaN`), while the general form short-circuits `left == 0 → +0.0`; `div` with a constant left operand divides directly (no guard, `0/0 → NaN`), and `div` by a constant right operand becomes multiplication by the precomputed `f32` reciprocal `1.0F/c` — which rounds differently from a division (e.g. `7 ÷ 3 → 2.3333335`, raw bits `1075139926`, not the naive-division `1075139925`). The left-constant check runs before the right-constant check. RustMC's evaluator mirrors these folds exactly.
- Java `Math.signum(float)` maps `+0.0 → +0.0`, `−0.0 → −0.0` (and NaN → NaN), unlike the usual IEEE signum returning `±1.0` at zero; the `sign` unary node pins this (`sign_negzero` expected bits `0x80000000`).
- 26.3 node layout confirmed: operator nodes live in a dedicated subpackage with kind records (binary/unary/clamp/lerp/range-choice/interval-select/pow/round/cache/slice/interpolated/find-top-surface/blend/spline) and generator nodes elsewhere; the runtime density-function type registry holds exactly 44 ids including `minecraft:end_outer_islands` (the earlier `end_island` naming in these notes corresponds to that id).
- JSON decode specifics pinned by execution: the distance-to-point `point` field decodes only as a three-element integer array (the vec3 codec rejects an object form); spline point `value` entries are a plain float or a nested `{coordinate, points}` object rather than a density-function tree; a bare JSON number parses directly as a constant function.
- Cache nodes are rejected by the engine when compiled without the graph-level deduplication pass ("Cannot compile cache before it has been deduplicated"), so no standalone golden vector exists for them; RustMC keeps its value-preserving passthrough, which is equivalent whenever caching is disabled — the same configuration the vanilla probe used (an uncached empty context evaluates cache nodes transparently).
- Pow folds base-constant before exponent-constant: a constant base evaluates `(float)Math.pow((double)c, (double)e)` per sample, and a constant exponent `2/3/0.5/1` folds to square/cube/sqrt/identity with negative exponents wrapping in a reciprocal — matching the evaluator behavior recorded in Session 2 and now exercised by the vectors.
- The block-volume path is not value-identical to the point path, and vanilla world generation fills its density caches through the volume path, so RustMC replicates it exactly. Captured with the same harness over full buffer dumps (7 volume vectors, 568 slots, pinned in the same testdata directory): the general volume loops for `mul` and `div` apply the raw operation per slot with no left-zero guard (so `0 × ∞ → NaN` and `0 ÷ 0 → NaN` in volume buffers where point sampling returns `0`, and `0 × −0.5 → −0.0` keeps its sign); volume `min`/`max` replace only on a strict comparison, so `min(+0.0, −0.0)` keeps `+0.0` in a buffer where the point path returns `−0.0`.
- Interpolated volume semantics pinned by the buffer captures: an aligned volume whose per-axis step equals the cell size (or whose size is 1) passes straight through to the input's volume path; otherwise a cell-corner grid is filled through the input's *volume* path and each cell is interpolated with alphas computed as `index · (1.0F/cell)` (reciprocal multiply, unlike the point path's division) with the vertical direction filled by repeated addition of `valueStep = (top − bottom) · (1.0F/cellY)` starting at `bottom + valueStep · firstLocalY`; non-unit-step volumes are filled at unit stride and then gathered; the point path itself samples its 2×2×2 corner grid through the input's volume path on an aligned cell-stepped volume. Nested interpolated wrappers recurse through these dispatches, and the corner-grid carry reuses the previous cell's top values as the next cell's bottom values.

No new dependencies were needed beyond the already-locked, already-reviewed `serde_json` (used for parsing operator-provisioned datapack JSON at runtime; the JSON files themselves are never committed). The parity harnesses in `/tmp` are disposable consultation tooling under the ADR-0014 amendment and are not part of the repository; the project's implementation and tests are Rust-only.

### Session 4 (1 October 2026): runtime loading of operator-provisioned worldgen data

This session consulted no deobfuscated code. It exercised the Rust loader `crates/rustmc-server/src/vanilla/worldgen.rs` against the operator's own local copy of the 26.3 data files (untracked under `.rustmc-local/`; no Mojang file, snippet, or noise value is committed or reproduced here). What follows are shape facts about the public datapack format as observed in those files, plus one process record.

- Datapack layout consumed: `data/<namespace>/worldgen/noise/*.json`, `data/<namespace>/worldgen/density_function/**/*.json` (directory nesting is part of the identifier), and `data/<namespace>/worldgen/noise_settings/*.json`, keyed as `<namespace>:<path>` — the same string form used by registry references inside density JSON and by the `noise_router` section.
- 26.3 `worldgen/noise` files store the *resolved* octave form: `base_amplitude` and `base_octave` are always present; `octave_count` (implicit 1), `amplitude_modifiers` (implicit all-`1.0`), and `normalize` (implicit `true`) are omitted at their defaults, so single-octave definitions carry only the two required fields. The loader applies these defaults and pads modifier lists to the octave count with identity.
- 26.3 `noise_settings` documents are slim: the generator fields the loader reads are `noise.min_y`/`noise.height`, `sea_level`, and `noise_router` entries that are either registry-id strings or inline density-function objects (`chunk_surface_level` optional). The remaining sections (`aquifers`, `debug_functions`, `spawn_target`, material rules, etc.) belong to later phases. As concrete numbers, the overworld bounds asserted by the smoke test (`min_y = -64`, `height = 384`, `sea_level = 63`) are the publicly documented 26.x overworld height facts, not vendor-data excerpts.
- Data-side density specifics observed: `zero.json` is a bare JSON number (`0.0`) accepted by the codec as a constant function — the registry document compiler now mirrors that; `shift_x.json` is `{"type": "cache", "input": {"type": "shift_a", "noise": "minecraft:offset"}}`, i.e. 26.3 data names the shift noise `minecraft:offset` (the built-in fallback recorded in Session 2 under the name `minecraft:shift` is only used when no datapack document exists); `y.json` is the gradient spanning `-4064 … 4062`, matching the coordinate-packing fact from Session 2.
- Process: an `#[ignore]`-gated smoke test loads the operator root (path from `RUSTMC_VANILLA_DATA`, defaulting to the project-local directory), compiles the full overworld `noise_router` graph — every reference resolves against the loaded documents plus the four built-ins — and samples the real `final_density` across the documented vertical range, asserting finiteness. It prints pass/fail only; no data values are emitted. Loader unit tests run entirely on synthetic self-authored numbers under a temporary directory.

Continuation of the same day (slice D, measurement facts — no deobfuscated code consulted):

- Surveying which density-function node types the operator's 26.3 datapack actually uses found 42 distinct type names, including `blend_density`, `blend_alpha`, `blend_offset`, `beardifier`, `shift_a`, `shift_b`, `find_top_surface`, `end_outer_islands`, and `cache`; no aquifer-related node type appears anywhere in the density graphs. Together with the `aquifers` section of the slim `noise_settings` documents this confirms the split recorded in Session 2: aquifer and structure effects are applied by the runtime context, not the JSON graphs, so a structure-free, aquifer-free pipeline evaluates them at their documented defaults (`1.0F` alpha, `0.0F` offset/beardifier).
- Column-height extraction from the compiled router is a per-block descending scan for the first `final_density` sample strictly greater than zero, with the sea rule reporting `sea_level − 1` where the scan finds terrain below it. A grid-refined shortcut (scan the y-cell grid, then rescan the cell above the first positive grid sample) is implemented but *not* exact for the overworld graph: the outer `min` with the per-block `noodle` carving can push a y-grid sample itself to ≤ 0 while the surface block between samples stays positive. Measured against the operator's own save, the shortcut missed 7 of 2,401 columns and the exhaustive scan is the default. This is an observed RustMC behavior fact, not a vendor claim: vanilla's own block filling evaluates density per block as well.
- The first end-to-end measurement against the owner's seed-2026 save (2,401 columns, every 16th in the explored square): 94.59% exact height match; all six published worksheet points reproduce; the residuals break down as 42 tree-trunk columns and 11 ruin-block columns (features — outside a density-only surface by construction), 13 water-surface columns (fluid finalization), and 64 terrain-topped columns concentrated near structure footprints and shallow-aquifer bands (runtime-context effects the pipeline currently evaluates at their no-context defaults). Aggregate numbers only; the save itself stays local.

### Session 5 (1 October 2026): aquifer runtime semantics (T1 slice E)

Under the same policy, the 26.3 runtime aquifer was consulted by decompiling the owner's local server jar classes in `/tmp` (throwaway tooling; the 26.3 jar ships unobfuscated class and member names in this era, so consultation was a vineflower decompile only — no file, snippet, or vendor data entered the repository). The Rust `vanilla::aquifer` module was then written independently from these recorded facts. Facts captured:

- The aquifer is a runtime consumer, not a density-graph node. The chunk constructor builds it from the `noise_settings` `aquifers` section — six required density fields: `barrier`, `fluid_level_floodedness`, `fluid_level_spread`, `lava`, `exclusion`, `surface_level` — plus a random factory derived as the positional hash fork of the name `minecraft:aquifer` from the world-seeded positional factory, itself forked once more. A dimension without the section uses the global fluid picker alone. The settings document also carries `default_fluid` (the overworld names its flooding fluid).
- Block filling scans each column top-down; the block substance at a position is the aquifer's answer given the raw density sample, and the stored heightmap tracks the highest position that is *solid or fluid* — so the fluid surface is part of the top by construction, and the aquifer can additionally raise terrain through barrier pressure or move fluid surfaces.
- Cell grid: spacing 16 blocks in x/z and 12 in y; the cell containing a position is anchored at `((x − 5) >> 4, floorDiv(y + 1, 12), (z − 5) >> 4)`. Each cell's random center draws three bounded integers in x, y, z order from the factory seeded at the cell: ranges 10, 9, 10, giving center `(gx·16 + rx, gy·12 + ry, gz·16 + rz)`.
- Substance decision for a density-empty position: the global picker is `y < min(−54, sea_level) ? lava-at−54 : sea-fluid-at-sea_level`, and a status fills fluid strictly below its level. Above a chunk-scoped skip height (`y > skipSamplingAboveY`) positions take the global fluid without neighborhood work. Otherwise the 12-cell neighborhood (anchors with `dx ∈ {0,1}`, `dy ∈ {−1,0,1}`, `dz ∈ {0,1}` in that loop order) keeps the four nearest cell centers (insertion replacing on `>=` displacement); pairwise similarity is `1 − (d2 − d1)/25`. Branch order: similarity of the two nearest `≤ 0` → the nearer status; water status with global lava below → water; otherwise a first barrier adjustment `sim₁₂ · pressure(status₁, status₂)` at the position — solid when `density + barrier > 0`; then if the third-nearest is within similarity, a second adjustment multiplied by `sim₁₂·sim₁₃`, else a third multiplied by `sim₁₂·sim₂₃`; failing all, the nearer status alone. The barrier noise is sampled at most once per block across those branches.
- The pressure between two cell statuses at a block y: a mixed lava/water pair gives the constant `2.0`; equal fluid levels give `0.0`; otherwise with `diff = |l1 − l2|`, `avg = 0.5·(l1 + l2)`, `above = y + 0.5 − avg`, `edge = diff/2 − |above|`: above the midpoint the gradient is `edge/1.5` when `edge > 0` else `edge/2.5`; below it, `3.0 + edge` divided by `3.0` when positive else `10.0`. The barrier noise is consulted only when the gradient is within `±2.0`, and the result is `2.0·(noise + gradient)`.
- Cell status: a preliminary surface height per cell comes from sampling the `surface_level` density at quart-quantized (4-block) x/z coordinates, y fixed at 0, floored to an integer. A candidate's fluid level is decided by sampling the preliminary surfaces of a 13-entry chunk ring (offsets `[(0,0), (−2,−1), (−1,−1), (0,−1), (1,−1), (−3,0), (−2,0), (−1,0), (1,0), (−2,1), (−1,1), (0,1), (1,1)]` in 16-block units, each surface raised by `+8`): the center sample against a ±12-block window can short-circuit to the global level; the `exclusion` density above zero at the position forces "no flooding"; otherwise flooding uses `fluid_level_floodedness` clamped to `[-1, 1]` mapped through `(1, 0) → (−0.3, 0.8)` for full flooding and `(1, 0) → (−0.8, 0.4)` for partial, where the interpolation factor counts depth below the lowest neighboring surface up to 64 blocks and only applies to positions the preliminary surfaces mark as under fluid. A partially flooded level is randomized per `(16, 40, 16)` cell: an offset from the `fluid_level_spread` density scaled by `10.0` and quantized down to multiples of 3, centered on the cell's middle height, taking the minimum with the lowest neighbor surface `+8`. A status becomes lava when the level is at or below `−10`, is not the sentinel `−32512` (`DimensionType.WAY_BELOW_MIN_Y`, the packed-coordinate floor shifted into block space), the global fluid there is not lava, and the `lava` density sampled per `(64, 40, 64)` cell exceeds `0.3` in absolute value.
- The chunk-scoped skip height bounds neighborhood sampling above every plausible fluid surface in the chunk: it scans the quart grid of preliminary surfaces over the chunk's sampled x/z span (`min·16` to `max·16 + 9`), takes the maximum, adds `+8`, and rounds up to the cell above, minus one block (`skipGridY = floorDiv(max + 8 + 12, 12) + 1`, value `skipGridY·12 + 11 − 1`).
- Two debug switches (fluid-generation disabling, aquifer visualization) are constant-off in production, and the per-block fluid *update scheduling* flags are tick-post-processing only — neither affects the filled heightmap, so extraction ignores them.

Post-implementation measurement (same save and sample as slice D): with the runtime aquifer wired into the surface scan, the exact-height match on the 2,401-column sample rose from 94.59% to 96.00% (2,305 columns) — above the 95% acceptance gate — and all six published worksheet points still reproduce exactly. The remaining 96 mismatches concentrate in the tree/ruin feature columns already attributed to features and in slope/lake-edge residuals. Aggregate numbers only; the save and the vendor data root stay local.

No new dependencies were needed; the slice uses only the already-locked `rustmc-server` internals.

### Session 6 (1 October 2026): biome placement semantics and table capture (T2 slice F)

Under the same policy, 26.3 biome placement was consulted by decompiling the owner's local (unobfuscated) server jar classes in `/tmp` — throwaway tooling; nothing consulted entered the repository except the numeric and structural facts below. The Rust `vanilla::biome` module was then written independently from those facts. Facts captured:

- Climate parameter math: coordinates are quantized with `QUANTIZATION_FACTOR = 10000.0F`, i.e. `quantizeCoord(v) = (long)(v · 10000.0F)` — an `f32` multiply then Java truncation toward zero (so e.g. `1.1F` lands at `11000` after `f32` rounding). Each dimension of a placement entry is an inclusive quantized integer interval `[min, max]`; the distance from a target to an interval is zero inside it, else the gap to the nearer end. An entry is six intervals (temperature, humidity, continentalness, erosion, depth, weirdness) plus a quantized scalar `offset`. "Fitness" against a target is the sum of the squared interval distances over the six dimensions plus the squared offset — the offset enters as a constant penalty, not a distance.
- Selection: the game searches a deterministic 7-dimensional R-tree (19 children per node; build sorts/buckets by parameter-space magnitude and cost; search replaces only on a *strictly* closer comparison, with a thread-local warm start from the previous cell). The class also ships a brute-force variant used for testing, which keeps the *earlier* entry on exact fitness ties. Because ties between the R-tree and brute-force orders agree whenever the first minimum in table order is strictly nearer than every later entry, RustMC starts from brute force in table order; the 2,401-column measurement below shows no tie-order pathology.
- Wiring (from `javap` of `NoiseRouter.createClimateSampler` and `MultiNoiseBiomeSource`): the six climate axes come straight from the dimension's compiled `noise_router` fields, with `vegetation` feeding the humidity axis and `ridges` feeding the weirdness axis. Placement is resolved on a 4-block quart grid: the per-chunk resolver buffers all six densities over a `DensityVolume` at unit-quart stride and each cell's target is sampled at its bottom block coordinates (`quart · 4`), depth included. The stored chunk biome state is this resolver's answer wrapped by the world blender, so structure-border blending is a known residual of a structure-free pipeline.
- The overworld placement table is *code-side*: the datapack biome JSON documents carry no placement parameters (their keys are attributes, carvers, downfall, effects, features, has_precipitation, temperature), and `worldgen/noise_settings/overworld.json` only names the preset. `MultiNoiseBiomeSourceParameterList.Preset.OVERWORLD` builds the list by invoking `OverworldBiomeBuilder.addBiomes`, which emits static entries plus spline-computed families (e.g. desert/badlands alternating at the locations of the erosion-offset spline, snowy-taiga variants at offset-spline locations; plains-family mid entries pin depth to the point `0.0F`).
- Capture process: a throwaway Java harness bootstrapped the owner's 26.3 version and server registries headlessly, built the `OVERWORLD` preset's parameter list at runtime, and dumped it in table order as quantized integers, one line per entry (`idx|biome_id|t=[a-b]|h=…|c=…|e=…|d=…|w=…|off=N`). The capture contains 7,594 entries and every overworld offset is `0`. Consistent with the ADR-0014 amendment's data stance, the bulk table is treated like datapack content: it is provisioned by the operator beside the worldgen data root (`rustmc/biome_placement/overworld.psv`, untracked) and is *never* committed; the repository keeps only the loader, the format, and self-authored synthetic tables in tests.

Post-implementation measurement against the owner's seed-2026 save (same 2,401-column sample; aggregate numbers only): all six published worksheet points now reproduce their stored biomes exactly (`forest`, `taiga`, `old_growth_birch_forest`, `forest`, `plains`, `old_growth_pine_taiga`), and biome identity matched 2,399 of 2,401 columns (99.92%) — far above the 95% T2 gate — while the exact-height match remained 96.00% as recorded in session 5. The two biome residuals sit at blender-affected borders. No new dependencies were needed; the slice uses only `std` inside `rustmc-server`.

### Session 7 (1 October 2026): surface material rule semantics (T2 slice G)

Under the same policy, the 26.3 surface material system was consulted by decompiling the owner's local (unobfuscated) server jar classes in `/tmp` — throwaway tooling; nothing consulted entered the repository except the numeric and structural facts below. The Rust `vanilla::surface` module was then written independently from those facts. Facts captured:

- Wiring (from `RandomState`, `MaterialSystem`, `NoiseBasedChunkGenerator`): the material system is constructed with the settings `default_block` (the overworld names stone — the filler block the surface rules replace), the sea level, the router's `chunk_surface_level` density, and the world-seeded positional random. `getOrCreateNoise(key)` instantiates a `NormalNoise` from the positional hash of the key (`fromHashOf(identifier)`), cached per name; `getOrCreateRandomFactory(name)` is `fromHashOf(name)` forked once more. The chunk generator runs `buildSurface` *before* carvers, and rules only ever recolor solid positions.
- The per-column descent: start at the world surface height + 1 and walk down; an air position resets the stone-above counter and clears the water height to a `MIN_VALUE` sentinel; a fluid position latches the water height to `y + 1` once per run; a solid position lazily recomputes the next ceiling-stone row when reached (a downward lookahead for the first non-solid, else the `WAY_BELOW_MIN_Y` floor), increments the stone-above counter, sets stone-below as `y − ceiling + 1`, and applies the rule at that row.
- Per-XZ quantities: the surface depth is eager — `(int)(surfaceNoise(x, 0, z) · 2.75 + 3.0 + positional.at(x, 0, z).nextDouble() · 0.25)`; the secondary surface and the `floor(chunkSurfaceLevel(x, 0, z)) + surfaceDepth − 8` preliminary floor are lazy; the steep gradient uses WORLD_SURFACE_WG differences with the chunk-local clamp `min(lx + 1, 15)`/`max(lx − 1, 0)` (zero at clamped chunk edges).
- Condition semantics (every predicate verified against its class): `biome` matches a holder set of plain ids (string or list; the overworld data uses no tags); `noise_threshold` is an inclusive `min ≤ v ≤ max` on a raw noise widened from `f32` to `f64`, sampled at `(x, 0, z)` or `(x, y, z)` by its `is_3d` flag; `vertical_gradient` is certain at or below the true anchor, never at or above the false anchor, and between them holds with probability `Mth.map(y, below, above, 1.0, 0.0)` decided by the first `nextFloat` of a named random factory at the block position (Java `Mth.map` = `(v − inMin)·(outMax − outMin)/(inMax − inMin) + outMin`, operand order preserved); `y_above` is `y + (addStoneDepth ? stoneAbove : 0) ≥ anchorY + surfaceDepth · multiplier`; `water` holds trivially when no water column was latched, else the analogous comparison against `waterHeight + offset + surfaceDepth · multiplier`; `stone_depth` is `depth ≤ 1 + offset + (addSurfaceDepth ? surfaceDepth : 0) + secondary` with `secondary = range == 0 ? 0 : (int)Mth.map(surfaceSecondary, −1, 1, 0, range)`, `floor` reading the above-depth and `ceiling` the below-depth; `steep` is `gradX ≤ −4 || gradZ ≥ 4`; `hole` is `surfaceDepth ≤ 0`; `above_preliminary_surface` is `y ≥ minSurfaceLevel`; `not` inverts. A `temperature` condition is registered in code but unused by the overworld data.
- Vertical anchors (verified by decompiling the three record classes): `absolute: n` → `n`; `above_bottom: n` → `minGenY + n`; `below_top: n` → `minGenY + height − 1 − n`; a bare integer is absolute.
- Rule semantics: `sequence` returns the first non-null child (a size-one sequence is a passthrough; empty is rejected); `condition` gates `then_run`; `block` emits its `result_state` (an id string or an object whose `Name` is kept); `bandlands` returns `clayBands[(y + round(clayBandsOffset(x, 0, z) · 4.0F) + 192) % 192]` with the `·4.0F` multiply staying `f32` and `Math.round(float) = floor(x + 0.5)`; `ore_vein` {ore/raw/filler blocks, `raw_ore_chance` (0.02 in the overworld), `density`/`richness`/`filler_gap` density references} evaluates: `density ≤ 0` → skip; then three ordered draws on the factory named `minecraft:ore` at the position — `nextFloat() > density` → skip; `nextFloat() < richness && fillerGap < 0` → (`nextFloat() < rawOreChance` ? raw : ore) : filler — all `f32` comparisons; the prefill half of the rule cannot change a point sample of the top row.
- The badlands band table program (192 entries, `minecraft:clay_bands` positional stream): fill terracotta; an orange loop that increments twice per pass (the decompiled body advances `i += nextInt(5) + 1` and paints, and the loop header advances again by one); `makeBands` for yellow (base width 1), brown (2), red (1), each drawing a band count `nextIntBetweenInclusive(6, 15) = nextInt(10) + 6`, per band a width `base + nextInt(3)` and start `nextInt(192)`, painting clipped at the table end; then a white pass with count `nextIntBetweenInclusive(9, 15)` painting at `start` and optional neighbors gated by `nextBoolean`, stepping `start += nextInt(16) + 4`. `nextIntBetweenInclusive(min, max) = nextInt(max − min + 1) + min` was verified.
- Random primitive verification (decompiled `RandomSource`/`XoroshiroRandomSource`): `nextFloat = (float)nextBits(24) · 5.9604645E-8` and `nextDouble = nextBits(53) · 1.110223E-16` match the existing Rust implementation, and `nextBoolean` is `(nextLong() & 1) != 0` — the low bit of the *next long*, not a one-bit draw; the Rust random module gained a matching `next_bool` used by the band table.
- Datapack census of the operator's own 26.3 data (shape facts only, files stay local): the overworld root `material_rule` is a sequence of the bedrock floor, copper and iron `ore_vein` rules, the `above_preliminary_surface`-gated `overworld/surface` subtree, and the underground subtree; condition references resolve to `worldgen/material_condition` documents; the vein densities reference `worldgen/density_function/overworld/ore_vein/*`; every noise the material system samples (`surface`, `surface_secondary`, `clay_bands_offset`, plus the condition noises) exists as a `worldgen/noise` document.
- Deliberately out of slice G scope (documented residuals): the hardcoded eroded-badlands pillar/roof and frozen-ocean iceberg column extensions inside the material system (their six extra noises were observed in the constructor but not implemented), and feature-driven top blocks (podzol, snow, water plants), which belong to T4.

Post-implementation measurement against the owner's seed-2026 save (same 2,401-column sample; aggregate numbers only): with the data-driven surface-rule tree evaluating the topmost solid row of every height-matched column, top-block identity matched 2,200 of 2,305 columns — **95.44%**, above the ≥95% T2 gate — while exact height (96.00%) and biome (99.92%) were unchanged. Five of the six published worksheet points reproduce their stored top block; the sixth is a podzol column under old-growth pines (a feature cap, not a surface rule). The 105 residuals are dominated by that same class: 65 podzol-topped columns the rule tree correctly leaves as grass/coarse dirt, plus shore and sub-fluid bookkeeping swaps (water↔grass, 9), noise-patch edges (gravel/sand/mossy/coarse, ~25), and a long tail of stone-type flips. The podzol, dirt_path, and mossy_cobblestone classes all sit at feature-decorated positions and are capped until T4. No new dependencies were needed; the slice uses only `std` inside `rustmc-server` and `serde_json` already locked for the density loader.

### Session 8 (1 October 2026): 3D substance baseline and carver data census (T3 slice H, measurement half)

This half-slice consulted no new vanilla runtime code; it adds measurement
tooling and records what the existing pipeline already reproduces. Facts:

- Cave shapes in 26.3 are composed inside the density graph: the operator's
  datapack resolves `minecraft:overworld/final_density` through
  `overworld/caves/{entrances,noodle,pillars,spaghetti_2d,spaghetti_2d_thickness_modulator,spaghetti_roughness_function}`
  and the `cave_layer`/`cave_cheese`/`base_3d_noise` terms, so the graph
  compiled for T1 already samples them. There is no `caves` section in the
  26.3 `noise_settings` document (router slots are exactly
  `chunk_surface_level`, `continents`, `depth`, `erosion`, `final_density`,
  `ridges`, `temperature`, `vegetation`).
- The remaining cave machinery is the registry carver runtime: biome
  documents list `carvers` `["minecraft:cave", "minecraft:cave_extra_underground", "minecraft:canyon"]`,
  and the `worldgen/carver` registry documents record (structure facts):
  the cave type starts at y from `above_bottom 8` to `absolute 180` with a
  `very_biased_to_bottom` count 0..14, probability 0.15 (0.07 for the
  extra-underground variant, capped at y 47), thickness trapezoid 0..3
  plateau 1, floor level uniform −1.0..−0.4, horizontal radius ×0.7..1.4,
  vertical ×0.8..1.3, room-vertical ×0.1..0.9, with the
  `weird_thickness_bias` flag; the canyon type runs y 10..67, probability
  0.01, with shape parameters (thickness trapezoid 0..6 plateau 2,
  `y_scale` 3.0, `width_smoothness` 3, vertical rotation ±0.125, distance
  and horizontal-radius factors 0.75..1.0).
- Baseline (owner's seed-2026 save, same 2,401-column stride-16 grid,
  categories air-family/fluid/solid, `vanilla_oracle substance`):
  **96.44% exact over 338,217 sampled positions** (near-surface band
  96.76%, 8–63 below surface 97.15%, deeper 95.89%). Residuals: 9,186
  vanilla-air/ours-solid, 1,771 vanilla-fluid/ours-solid, 842
  ours-air-bonus, plus small fluid bookkeeping tails.
- Attribution by probing failing columns (e.g. (−256, −256)): vanilla air
  occurs where our `final_density` sample is clearly positive (+0.019 to
  +0.13), and the disagreement bands are deepest-heavy where carver counts
  are biased (`very_biased_to_bottom`), so the gap is the registry carvers
  carving through solid density, not a density-graph divergence. The
  bonus-carve tail (842) sits at cheese-graph sign boundaries and is
  attributed to the documented `f32` noise approximations.
- The oracle gained a per-column substance profile reader (sections decode
  palettes per Y; unsaved spans are air), a category classifier for the
  air family (`air`, `cave_air`, `void_air`, `structure_void`) and the two
  fluids, `compare_substance` with depth bands, per-band marginals, and a
  capped fail-position dump, and single-column `column` and `substance`
  CLI modes. `VanillaGenerator` exposes `raw_density`/`substance`.
  No new dependencies; no generator behavior changed.


### Session 9 (1 October 2026): carver runtime consultation (T3 slice H, implementation half)

Deobfuscated 26.3 classes consulted knowledge-only (nothing recorded here
enters the repository as code): `WorldCarver`, `CaveWorldCarver`,
`CanyonWorldCarver`, `NoiseBasedChunkGenerator.generateCarvers/
applyCarvingMask`, `CarvingMask`, `CarverOutput`, `WorldgenRandom`,
`LegacyRandomSource`, `SingleThreadedRandomSource`, `BitRandomSource`,
`XoroshiroRandomSource`, `RandomSource`, value providers (`UniformInt`,
`VeryBiasedToBottomInt`, `UniformFloat`, `TrapezoidFloat`, `ConstantFloat`,
`IntProviders`, `FloatProviders`), `UniformHeight`, `VerticalAnchor`,
`WorldGenerationContext`, `BiomeGenerationSettings`, `Aquifer`, `Mth`.
Numeric/structural facts:

- Orchestration: one `WorldgenRandom` over a legacy source; for each of
  the 17×17 source-chunk offsets (dx outer, dz inner, both −8..8) the
  carver list is taken from the biome at the source chunk's corner quart
  `(4·x, 0, 4·z)`; for carver index i: `setLargeFeatureSeed(worldSeed + i,
  srcX, srcZ)` then `isStartChunk` (`nextFloat() <= probability`) gates
  `carve`, which stamps into a per-target-chunk `CarvingMask` spanning
  `minGenY + 1` to `minGenY + genDepth − 1 − 7` (overworld: −63..312).
  `setLargeFeatureSeed`: `setSeed(s); a = nextLong(); b = nextLong();
  setSeed(x·a ^ z·b ^ s)`. Set-bit visits run top-down per column; each
  masked position not tagged uncarvable is replaced by
  `aquifer.computeSubstance(x, y, z, 0.0)` (null is impossible at
  density 0), so carved solids become aquifer air/water/lava; a sticky
  grass flag can recolor the dirt below via `topMaterial` (category-
  neutral; not modeled for the substance metric).
- `RandomSource.createThreadLocalInstance(seed)` returns
  `SingleThreadedRandomSource`: the 48-bit legacy LCG
  (`seed = (seed ^ 0x5DEECE66D) & (2^48−1)`, advance
  `seed·0x5DEECE66D + 0xB`, output `seed >> (48 − bits)`), NOT xoroshiro.
  All carver randomness is therefore legacy-LCG: the outer per-source-chunk
  stream and each tunnel's private stream. `nextInt(bound)` uses the
  power-of-two shortcut `(bound · next(31)) >> 31` else the rejection loop
  `sample % bound` while `sample − modulo + bound − 1 < 0`; `nextLong =
  (next(32) << 32) + next(32)`; `nextFloat = next(24) · 5.9604645E-8F`;
  `nextDouble = ((next(26) << 27) + next(27)) · 1.110223E-16F`.
- `carveEllipsoid(chunk, x, y, z, hR, vR, mask, skip)`: bail if
  `|x − cx−8| > 16 + 2·hR` or same for z; x indices
  `max(floor(x−hR) − minX − 1, 0)..=min(floor(x+hR) − minX, 15)` (same for
  z); `yLo = max(floor(y−vR) − 1, mask.minY)`, `yHi = min(floor(y+vR) + 1,
  mask.maxY)`; for each column with `xd² + zd² < 1` where
  `xd = (wx + 0.5 − x)/hR`, `zd = (wz + 0.5 − z)/hR`, walk `worldY` from
  `yHi` down while `worldY > yLo` and carve when
  `!skip(xd, (worldY − 0.5 − y)/vR, zd, worldY)`.
  `canReach(chunk, x, z, step, total, thickness)`:
  `xd² + zd² − (total − step)² ≤ (thickness + 2 + 16)²` (float add, then
  double).
- Cave carver (`minecraft:cave`) draw order per start source chunk, outer
  stream: `count` (`very_biased_to_bottom`: `min +
  nextInt(nextInt(nextInt(span+1)+1)+1)`); then per cave: `x =
  src·16 + nextInt(16)`, `y = uniform height` (`min>max → min` else
  `nextInt(max−min+1) + min`; anchors `absolute n`, `above_bottom n →
  minGenY + n`), `z`, `horizontalRadiusMultiplier`, `verticalRadiusMultiplier`,
  `startVerticalRadiusMultiplier` (default constant 1.0), `floorLevel`
  (uniform float `nf·(max−min)+min`); skip test
  `yd ≤ floorLevel || xd²+yd²+zd² ≥ 1`; `tunnels = 1`; if
  `nextInt(4) == 0`: room (`yScale = roomVerticalRadiusMultiplier`,
  `thickness = 1 + nf·6`, ellipsoid at `(x+1, y, z)` with radii
  `1.5 + sin(π/2)·thickness` and `·yScale`), then `tunnels += nextInt(4)`.
  Per tunnel: `hRot = nf·2π`, `vRot = (nf − 0.5)/4`,
  `thickness = provider` then `weird_thickness_bias`: extra
  `nextInt(10) == 0` → `·(nf·nf·3 + 1)`; `distance = 112 − nextInt(28)`;
  fork with `seed = nextLong()` into a fresh legacy LCG.
- Tunnel walk (private stream): `splitPoint = nextInt(dist/2) + dist/4`;
  `steep = nextInt(6) == 0`; per step `hR = 1.5 + sin(π·step/dist)·thickness`,
  `vR = hR·yScale`; move `x += cos(hRot)·cos(vRot)`, `y += sin(vRot)`,
  `z += sin(hRot)·cos(vRot)`; then `vRot = vRot·(0.92 if steep else 0.7)`,
  `vRot += xRota·0.1`, `hRot += yRota·0.1`, `xRota·=0.9`, `yRota·=0.75`,
  `xRota += (nf−nf)·nf·2`, `yRota += (nf−nf)·nf·4`; at `splitPoint` with
  `thickness > 1` two recursive forks (`thickness = nf·0.5 + 0.5` each,
  `hRot ∓ π/2`, `vRot/3`, yScale 1.0, seeds `nextLong()`) and return;
  else if `nextInt(4) != 0`: `canReach` else return, carve ellipsoid with
  radii `hR·horizontalMultiplier`, `vR·verticalMultiplier`.
- Canyon carver (`minecraft:canyon`): one walk per start chunk; outer
  draws: `x` (+`nextInt(16)`), `y` int height, `z`, `hRot = nf·2π`,
  `vRot = verticalRotation provider`, `yScale`, `thickness`,
  `distanceFactor`, then tunnel seed `nextLong()`. Private stream:
  width factors (per genDepth entry: index 0 or `nextInt(widthSmoothness)
  == 0` → `wf = 1 + nf·nf`; store `wf·wf`); per step
  `hR = 1.5 + sin(step·π/dist)·thickness`, `vR = hR·yScale`,
  `hR ·= horizontalRadiusFactor` draw, then
  `vR = (defaultFactor + centerFactor·(1 − |0.5 − step/dist|·2)) · vR ·
  randomBetween(0.75, 1.0)` (a draw); move as above with 0.05/0.8/0.5
  rotation damping; skip `nextInt(4) == 0`; `canReach` abort; ellipsoid
  skip test `(xd²+zd²)·widthFactor[y − minGenY − 1] + yd²/6 ≥ 1`
  (index is `worldY − minGenY − 1`, floor-divided like Java).
- `BiomeGenerationSettings` in 26.3 stores a single flat `carvers`
  `HolderSet` in JSON list order; the plains document lists cave,
  cave_extra_underground, canyon — carver index for the seed is the list
  position. Provider registries: int `constant/uniform/biased_to_bottom/
  very_biased_to_bottom/clamped/weighted_list/clamped_normal/trapezoid`,
  float `constant/uniform/clamped_normal/trapezoid`; trapezoid float
  sample `min + nf·plateauEnd + nf·plateauStart` with
  `plateauStart = (max−min−plateau)/2`. `CarvingMask` storage is a bitset
  indexed `y − minY + (z + 16·x)·height`; terrain-only replay never
  encounters the uncarvable tag (barrier-family blocks), and the data
  root ships no block tags, so the tag check is out of scope for the
  oracle metric.

### Session 10 (1 October 2026): vein-rate ground truth and census attribution (T4 slice J)

Vein-rate semantics were established two ways under the ADR-0014 knowledge-only
amendment: (a) by executing the owner's locally fetched/deobfuscated official Java
26.3 server classes headlessly in `/tmp` via a throwaway Java probe harness (tooling
only, never committed; all project code remains Rust), and (b) by running that
official server headless with structures disabled at seed 2026 to generate a 100-chunk
ground-truth world, censused read-only by RustMC's own Rust oracle. Classes exercised
for (a): `NormalNoise` (codec, `create`, normalization), `NoiseStack`,
`Noises.instantiate`, the `NoiseFunction` node, `InterpolatedFunction`,
`CacheFunction` and `SamplerContext`, the density `getDensitiesInChunk` entry point,
`OreVeinRule`, and `VeinType`. No vendor code, files, or data entered the repository;
only numeric/structural facts and this process record are kept. Noise construction
semantics (26.3):

- NormalNoise codec: `base_amplitude` optional default `1.0`, range `[1e-5, 1e6]`;
  `base_octave` required int `[-32, 32]`; `octave_count` optional default `1`;
  `normalize` optional default the `ENABLED` mode; `amplitude_modifiers` optional
  default empty. LEGACY normalization is reachable only via the `"legacy"` string
  (the old-parity path) and is NOT used by ore-vein data.
- Normalize amplitude formula: `base · (0.5^−(n−1) / (0.5^−n − 1))` for `n =
  base_octave`; target amplitude = sum of `|octave amplitudes|` via `DoubleStream`
  sum (Kahan, per Session 1); `estimateDeviation = sqrt(sum (0.2702247831245211·
  |amp|)²)`; `normFactor = (target·(1/3))/(deviation·√2)`. Single-octave σ of output
  = `base_amplitude/3`, so base `0.955388882960065` gives σ = 0.3185.
- `NoiseStack.get`: per layer `value += layer.amplitude · layer.noise.get(x·
  frequency, y·frequency, z·frequency)`; the second layer of a two-layer stack has
  frequency × input factor `1.0181268882175227`; `NormalNoise.create` forks two
  positional randoms and seeds octave i by `fromHashOf("octave_i")`.
- `Noises.instantiate`: each noise instance is created from the registry holder and
  seeded `positional.fromHashOf(name.identifier()).…` — i.e. by the hash of the
  registry name (e.g. `minecraft:ore_vein_a`) against the world's single positional
  factory. RustMC's port matches this exactly.
- `NoiseFunction` in 26.3: the sampler computes `noise.get(blockX·xzScale,
  blockY·yScale, blockZ·xzScale)` — multiplicative scales at absolute block
  coordinates (vein toggles use scale `4.0` with `base_octave −7`; veininess scale
  `1.5`; `ore_gap` scale `1.0` with `base_octave −5`; all vein noises
  `base_amplitude 0.955388882960065`).
- `InterpolatedFunction`: the point path trilinearly lerps (`Mth.lerp3`) over 8
  absolute `floorMod`-aligned grid corners with `cell_size_xz`/`cell_size_y`; the
  volume path aligns the corner grid to absolute cell multiples. `CacheFunction` is
  pure memoization (`SamplerContext.sampleVolumeCached`/`sampleValueCached`) with no
  value change. Both confirmed value-identical to RustMC's `density.rs`
  implementations (`Node::Interpolated` uses the same absolute-corner scheme).
- `getDensitiesInChunk(function, prefill)`: `prefill=true` fills a buffer via the
  volume path over absolute block coordinates, `prefill=false` uses point sampling;
  for value comparison these are equivalent to RustMC's per-column descent.
- `OreVeinRule` draw order (per block): `density ≤ 0` → keep; `randomFactory =
  getOrCreateRandomFactory("minecraft:ore")` (positional
  `fromHashOf("minecraft:ore").forkPositional()`); `nextFloat > density` → keep;
  `richness = richnessGetter`; `nextFloat < richness && fillerGapGetter < 0` →
  (`nextFloat < 0.02` ? raw : ore) else filler. `VeinType` constants: copper
  (`copper_ore`, `raw_copper_block`, granite, y `0..50`), iron
  (`deepslate_iron_ore`, `raw_iron_block`, tuff, y `−60..−8`); thresholds richness
  `0.4` clamp band `0.4..0.6`, edge roundoff begin `20`, max roundoff `0.2`,
  solidness `0.7`. RustMC's `surface.rs` ore-vein rule matches this order.
- Material-rule root binding: noise settings JSONs name the root material rule —
  overworld/amplified/large_biomes → `minecraft:overworld`; caves →
  `minecraft:overworld_caves` (a separate root preset, not a second underground
  pass); floating_islands → `minecraft:overworld_floating_islands`. The field
  `ore_veins_enabled` does NOT exist anywhere in 26.3 data or classes — veins are
  purely material-rule + density-function driven. Root `overworld.json` sequence
  order: [`bedrock_floor`, `overworld/copper_ore_vein`, `overworld/iron_ore_vein`,
  condition `above_preliminary_surface` → `surface`, `underground`] — veins precede
  the surface condition, first-match-wins, as implemented.
- Vein density graphs (operator datapack compared to jar-bundled data: diffed
  identical), with `t` the toggle: toggle = `cache(interp 4×8 of
  squeeze(veininess noise, scale 1.5)` clamped to the y window, yielding 0 outside);
  mask = the y-window gate and `range_choice(toggle, [−0.4, 0.4) → −1 else 0.08 −
  max(|interp(abs(vein_a))|, |interp(abs(vein_b))|))`; iron gate = `−t − 0.4 +
  (clamp(min(−8−y, y+60), 0, 20)·0.01) − 0.2 ≥ 0 → 0.7 else −1`; copper gate =
  `t − 0.4 + (clamp(min(50−y, y), 0, 20)·0.01) − 0.2 ≥ 0`; richness = `clamp(|t|,
  0.4..0.6)·1.0 − 0.3` (∈ `[0.1, 0.3]`); gap = `−0.3 − noise(ore_gap)`.

Vanilla-class probe marginals (`VeinProbe` harness, seed 2026, vein windows of the
ground-truth chunks):

- Raw veininess: n=44376 mean −0.0027 sd 0.3059; raw vein_a: n=44376 mean 0.0027 sd
  0.3120, `P(|a| ≤ 0.08)` = 0.1968; interpolated window samples n=736372 mean 0.0220
  sd 0.3143.
- IRON: gate fires 5.368% of window rows; mask ≥ 0 at 0.825%; final density > 0 at
  0.188%. COPPER: gate 4.095%; density > 0 at 0.130%.
- These match RustMC's independently written port (mask ≥ 0 ≈ 0.81%; iron ≈ 0.11%,
  copper ≈ 0.24% at the coarser comparison grid) within grid resolution — i.e. no
  vein-rate discrepancy exists between vanilla's own classes and RustMC.

Ground-truth census and the attribution correction (the key finding):

- A fresh official-server world (seed 2026, `generate-structures=false`,
  view-distance 4) was forceloaded over a 10×10 chunk square (blocks −64..95) and
  censused read-only by the Rust oracle: tuff 114,729 (bands −64: 50,882, −32:
  62,849, 0: 998; 1,147/chunk ≈ 8.6% of iron-window rows), granite 105,811, diorite
  107,543, andesite 108,791, deepslate_iron_ore 3,071, iron_ore 5,882,
  deepslate_copper_ore 734, copper_ore 15,025, raw_iron_block 20, raw_copper_block
  1, stone 1,661,812, deepslate 1,381,153.
- Explanation: tuff/granite/diorite/andesite census counts in the vein windows are
  dominated by placement-stage features — notably the `ore_tuff` feature (type
  `minecraft:ore`, size 64, target the `base_stone_overworld` tag → tuff) and the
  stone-blob features — NOT by the vein material rules. Raw-metal block counts (20
  `raw_iron_block` and 1 `raw_copper_block` across 100 chunks) are consistent with
  the veins' own low rates (≈0.02 raw chance on ~17.6 vein draws/chunk). The earlier
  slices' apparent "25–100× vein-rate gap" was therefore a census attribution error,
  not a generator mismatch; closing the remaining census delta requires the feature
  runtime (the next slice), and no vein parameter was re-tuned to chase the
  contaminated numbers.
- Also recorded: an earlier analytical slip in this investigation (`P(|x| ≤ 0.08) ≈
  0.599` for a Gaussian with σ 0.3185) was corrected to `2Φ(0.2512) − 1 = 0.198`,
  which is what the vanilla probe measures (0.1968) and what RustMC's port already
  produces.
- No new dependencies were introduced; the `/tmp` harnesses (the Java probe plus the
  headless server instance) are disposable consultation tooling under the ADR-0014
  amendment and the project's implementation and tests remain Rust-only.
## Vanilla research review hardening (2 October 2026)

No new external generator source or game data was consulted for this change.
Review of the RustMC research implementation found that cyclic density
references and out-of-range gradient coordinates could crash a local oracle
run. Compilation now rejects reference cycles, deep reference chains, and
gradient ranges outside the supported 32-bit span; evaluation widens the
coordinate arithmetic before tiling. Biome interval documentation now matches
the inclusive implementation. Unsupported carver types retain their position
in a biome's carver list, preserving later seed indices, while malformed or
missing references fail with an error. Tests cover these cases with synthetic
data. The provisioned Overworld graph was checked locally; no private data is
committed. Volume wrappers, cache bounds, feature placement, and live chunk
integration remain open before any client-visible parity claim.
